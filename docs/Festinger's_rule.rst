随笔八 费斯汀格法则（为打翻的牛奶哭泣）
======================

什么是费斯汀格法则:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

费斯汀格法则是指美国社会心理学家费斯汀格（Festinger）的一个很出名的判断：生活中的10％是由发生在你身上的事情组成，而另外的90％则是由你对所发生的事情如何反应所决定。换言之，生活中有10%的事情是我们无法掌控的，而另外的90%却是我们能掌控的。


费斯汀格法则的释义:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

费斯汀格在书中举了这样一个例子。
卡斯丁早上起床后洗漱时，随手将自己高档手表放在洗漱台边，妻子怕被水淋湿了，就随手拿过去放在餐桌上。儿子起床后到餐桌上拿面包时，不小心将手表碰到地上摔坏了。卡斯丁疼爱手表，就照儿子的屁股揍了一顿。然后黑着脸骂了妻子一通。妻子不服气，说是怕水把手表打湿。卡斯丁说他的手表是防水的。于是二人猛烈地斗嘴起来。一气之下卡斯丁早餐也没有吃，直接开车去了公司，快到公司时突然记起忘了拿公文包，又立刻转回家。可是家中没人，妻子上班去了，儿子上学去了，卡斯丁钥匙留在公文包里，他进不了门，只好打电话向妻子要钥匙。妻子慌慌张张地往家赶时，撞翻了路边水果摊，摊主拉住她不让她走，要她赔偿，她不得不赔了一笔钱才摆脱。待拿到公文包后，卡斯丁已迟到了15分钟，挨了上司一顿严厉批评，卡斯丁的心情坏到了极点。下班前又因一件小事，跟同事吵了一架。妻子也因早退被扣除当月全勤奖，儿子这天参加棒球赛，原本夺冠有望，却因心情不好发挥不佳，第一局就被淘汰了。在这个事例中，手表摔坏是其中的10%，后面一系列事情就是另外的90%。都是由于当事人没有很好地掌控那90%，才导致了这一天成为“闹心的一天”。试想，卡斯丁在那10%产生后，假如换一种反应。比如，他抚慰儿子：“不要紧，儿子，手表摔坏了没事，我拿去修修就好了。”这样儿子高兴，妻子也高兴，他本身心情也好，那么随后的一切就不会发生了。可见，你控制不了前面的10％，但完全可以通过你的心态与行为决定剩余的90％。


### Festinger's Cognitive Dissonance Theory in Detail

#### **1. Introduction to Cognitive Dissonance Theory**
Leon Festinger introduced the theory of cognitive dissonance in 1957 in his book "A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance". The theory posits that individuals strive for consistency among their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. When inconsistencies arise, individuals experience psychological discomfort, known as cognitive dissonance, which motivates them to reduce or eliminate this discomfort.

#### **2. Core Concepts**
- **Cognition**: Any knowledge, opinion, or belief about the environment, oneself, or one's behavior.
- **Dissonance**: A relation between two cognitions where one cognition contradicts or is inconsistent with the other.
- **Consonance**: A relation between two cognitions that are consistent with each other.

#### **3. Causes of Cognitive Dissonance**
Cognitive dissonance arises when an individual holds two or more cognitions that are mutually inconsistent. For example:
- **Behavior-Attitude Inconsistency**: Engaging in a behavior that contradicts one's attitude or belief. For instance, smoking despite knowing it is harmful.
- **Decision-Making**: Making a difficult decision where each option has both positive and negative aspects can lead to dissonance after the decision is made.

#### **4. Effects of Cognitive Dissonance**
The presence of cognitive dissonance leads to psychological discomfort, which in turn motivates the individual to reduce or eliminate the dissonance. This discomfort can manifest as feelings of unease, tension, or anxiety.

#### **5. Strategies to Reduce Cognitive Dissonance**
Individuals use various strategies to reduce cognitive dissonance:
1. **Change Behavior**: Alter the behavior to align with the attitude or belief. For example, quitting smoking to align with the belief that smoking is harmful.
2. **Change Attitude or Belief**: Modify the attitude or belief to align with the behavior. For example, justifying smoking by believing that it helps reduce stress.
3. **Add New Cognitions**: Introduce new beliefs or information that can reconcile the inconsistency. For example, learning about the benefits of smoking cessation programs.
4. **Trivialize the Inconsistency**: Minimize the importance of the inconsistency. For example, believing that the health risks of smoking are exaggerated.

#### **6. Factors Influencing the Magnitude of Cognitive Dissonance**
- **Choice and Control**: The more choice an individual has over the inconsistency, the stronger the dissonance. For example, choosing to smoke despite knowing the risks leads to higher dissonance than smoking due to addiction.
- **Expected Consequences**: The more severe the expected negative consequences of the inconsistency, the stronger the dissonance. For example, the fear of developing lung cancer from smoking increases dissonance.

#### **7. Experimental Evidence**
Festinger and Carlsmith's forced-compliance paradigm demonstrated that individuals who were paid less for performing a boring task later rated the task as more enjoyable than those who were paid more. This is because the lower reward increased the dissonance, motivating them to change their attitude towards the task.

#### **8. Real-World Applications**
- **Marketing and Advertising**: Understanding cognitive dissonance can help marketers design more effective campaigns. For example, a company might highlight the benefits of its product to reduce dissonance among potential customers.
- **Health Behavior**: Public health campaigns can use cognitive dissonance to encourage healthy behaviors. For example, by highlighting the negative consequences of smoking, campaigns can increase dissonance and motivate individuals to quit.

#### **9. Criticisms and Limitations**
- **Ambiguity in Defining Dissonance**: Determining which beliefs are inconsistent can be challenging, as cognitive elements may not always be precisely defined.
- **Cultural Differences**: The theory may not account for cultural variations in how individuals perceive and resolve dissonance.

#### **10. Conclusion**
Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory provides a framework for understanding how individuals strive for consistency in their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. By recognizing and addressing cognitive dissonance, individuals can reduce psychological discomfort and make more informed decisions.

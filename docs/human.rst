随笔四十一 人性
======================

“关于人性，最让您感到惊讶的是什么？”


“人类，为了赚钱，他牺牲健康。为了修复身体，他牺牲钱财。然后，因担心未来，他无法享受现在。就这样，他无法活在当下。活着时，他忘了生命是短暂的。死时，他才发现他未曾好好地活着。”？

"Carpe diem" is a Latin phrase that translates to "seize the day" in English. It is a philosophical concept that encourages individuals to make the most of the present moment, to live life to the fullest, and not to postpone or delay actions that can be taken now. This idea has been a recurring theme in literature, poetry, and philosophy for centuries, and it continues to resonate with people today. Let's delve into the origins, meaning, and applications of "carpe diem" in detail.

### Origins
The phrase "carpe diem" originates from the Roman poet Horace's work "Odes" (Book 1, Poem 11). In this poem, Horace writes:

> "Dum loquimur, fugerit invida aetas: carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero."
>
> Translation: "While we're talking, envious time is fleeing: seize the day, put no trust in tomorrow (the Latin word 'cras' can mean 'tomorrow' or 'the future')."

Horace's message here is a call to action, urging people to live in the present and not to rely on the uncertainties of the future. This idea was part of a broader philosophical movement in ancient Rome that emphasized the fleeting nature of life and the importance of making the most of it.

### Meaning
"Carpe diem" is often interpreted as a call to live in the moment, to take advantage of the opportunities that come your way, and to not waste time on indecision or procrastination. It is a reminder that life is short and unpredictable, and that the best way to ensure fulfillment and happiness is to act now rather than waiting for a future that may never come.

### Applications
The concept of "carpe diem" has been applied in various contexts throughout history. Here are a few examples:

#### **1. Literature and Poetry**
- **Robert Herrick's "To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time"**:
  > "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old Time is still a-flying; And this same flower that smiles today, Tomorrow will be dying."
  >
  This poem is a classic example of the "carpe diem" theme, encouraging young women to seize the moment and enjoy life while they are young.

- **Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet"**:
  > "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun."
  >
  In this famous scene, Romeo urges Juliet to seize the moment and defy societal expectations to be together.

#### **2. Philosophy**
- **Existentialism**:
  Existentialist philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus emphasized the importance of living authentically and making the most of one's freedom. The idea of "carpe diem" aligns with their belief that individuals should create their own meaning in life by actively engaging with the present moment.

- **Stoicism**:
  Stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus taught that one should focus on what is within their control and not be overly concerned with the future. "Carpe diem" can be seen as a practical application of this philosophy, encouraging individuals to take control of their lives by acting in the present.

#### **3. Modern Culture**
- **Movies and TV Shows**:
  The phrase "carpe diem" has been popularized in modern culture through movies and TV shows. For example, in the film "Dead Poets Society," the character John Keating, played by Robin Williams, encourages his students to "seize the day" and make their lives extraordinary.

- **Self-Help and Motivational Literature**:
  Many self-help books and motivational speakers use the concept of "carpe diem" to inspire people to take action and pursue their dreams. The idea is often presented as a way to overcome procrastination and fear of failure.

### Practical Implications
Living by the principle of "carpe diem" can have several positive effects on one's life:

- **Increased Happiness**: By focusing on the present moment and making the most of it, individuals can experience greater happiness and satisfaction.
- **Reduced Regret**: Taking action now rather than putting things off can help reduce feelings of regret later in life.
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Seizing the day can lead to increased productivity and the achievement of personal and professional goals.
- **Improved Relationships**: Living in the moment can also enhance relationships, as individuals are more present and engaged with others.

### Conclusion
"Carpe diem" is a timeless concept that encourages individuals to live fully in the present moment and to take advantage of the opportunities that come their way. Whether in literature, philosophy, or modern culture, the idea of seizing the day continues to inspire people to live their lives to the fullest. By embracing this principle, individuals can experience greater happiness, productivity, and fulfillment, ultimately leading to a more meaningful and satisfying life.
